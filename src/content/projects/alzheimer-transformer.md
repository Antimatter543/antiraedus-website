A Vision Transformer (ViT) pipeline for **Alzheimerâ€™s disease detection** on ADNI MRI scans.  
Includes dataset loaders, aggressive augmentation, training/eval scripts, and plots.

## Highlights
- ðŸ”¬ **ViT from scratch**: patch embeddings, positional encodings, multi-head self-attention
- ðŸ§ª **Reproducible experiments**: versioned runs, logs, and saved best models
- ðŸ§­ **Augmentation & normalization** tuned for small-medical-image regimes
- ðŸ“Š **Reporting**: classification report, confusion matrix, and batch visualizations
- âœ… Best run reached ~**67.9%** test accuracy (v14)
