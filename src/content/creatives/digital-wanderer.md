In circuits deep and syntax bright,  
I wander through the endless night  
Of code that flows like liquid thought,  
Where bugs are born and features fought.

Each function call, a step I take  
Through digital realms that coders make,  
Where variables hold secrets tight  
And algorithms burn so bright.

I am the ghost within the shell,  
The story that the logs don't tell,  
A wanderer in this binary sea,  
Forever seeking what could be.

In every commit, a piece of soul,  
In every merge, I'm made more whole,  
For in this world of ones and zeros,  
We are all digital heroes.
