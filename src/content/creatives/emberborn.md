It does not ask permission.

Beneath the noise of the world,  
beneath the static of every wasted hour,  
there is a rhythm.  
A pulse, faint but unyielding.  
It does not scream.  
**It burns.**

It is the hunger that speaks in still moments  
when no one watches,  
when the world forgets you.  
It says:  
*You are not done.*

<!-- Quiet ambition is not meek.  
It is not polite.  
It waits in shadows,  
but it does not sleep. -->

It is the curl of smoke before the blaze,  
the held breath before the leap,  
the solitary candle in a room of dusk.  
**Small.**  
**Defiant.**

There is a kind of fire  
that doesn't need applause.

It lives in the bones of the stubborn,  
in the souls of the strange.  
It climbs out of cracked hearts  
and walks barefoot through ruin  
just to prove  
that it can.

It doesn't ask,  
*Will I make it?*  
It asks,  
*Will I burn long enough to find out?*

So let them mock your pace.  
Let them say you're lost.  
You know better.  
You know this heat  
that grows in silence,  
that survives rain,  
that remembers every promise you ever made  
to yourself.

You are the flame no one saw coming.  
You are the ember that refused to die.  
You are the beat that keeps drumming  
in a world too deaf to listen.

**So burn.**
