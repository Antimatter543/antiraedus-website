The clock struck 2 AM as Sarah stared at the screen, her eyes burning from hours of debugging. The error message mocked her: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined`. She'd seen it a thousand times before, but this time was different. This time, the variable *should* have been defined.

She traced through the code again, line by line, adding console.log statements like breadcrumbs in a digital forest. Each log revealed another piece of the puzzle, but the picture they formed made no sense.

The function was called. The parameter was passed. The object was there—except when it wasn't.

"Schrödinger's bug," she muttered, taking another sip of cold coffee.

Then, in line 247 of a file she'd barely touched, she found it. A single character. A semicolon where there should have been a comma. Such a small thing to cause such chaos.

But as she fixed the typo, Sarah realized something profound: every bug was a story. Every error was the program trying to tell her something about the world she'd created in code. And every successful fix was a conversation between human intention and machine logic.

She saved the file, ran the tests, and watched them all pass. The clock now read 2:17 AM, but she felt more awake than she had all day.

Sometimes the code teaches you more than you teach it.
