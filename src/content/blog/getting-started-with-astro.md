# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern static site builder that provides an excellent developer experience and optimized output. Let me share why I chose Astro for my portfolio website and how you can get started with it too.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a new kind of static site builder that delivers lightning-fast performance with a modern developer experience. It allows you to write components in your favorite UI framework (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.) and then renders them to static HTML at build time, resulting in zero JavaScript sent to the client by default.

## Why Choose Astro?

There are several reasons why Astro might be the right choice for your next project:

1. **Speed**: Astro websites are incredibly fast because they ship zero JavaScript by default.
2. **Flexibility**: Use your favorite UI framework or just plain HTML + CSS.
3. **Easy to learn**: If you know HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, you can build with Astro.
4. **Markdown support**: Perfect for blog posts and documentation.
5. **Optimized assets**: Astro optimizes your images and other assets for you.

## Getting Started

Here's how to create a new Astro project:

```bash
# Create a new project
npm create astro@latest

# Install dependencies
cd my-astro-project
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

## Creating Components

Astro components use a syntax similar to JSX, but with some differences:

```astro
---
// Component Script (JavaScript)
const title = "Hello, Astro!";
---

<!-- Component Template (HTML + JS Expressions) -->
<h1>{title}</h1>
<p>This is an Astro component</p>

<style>
  /* Component Styles (Scoped by default) */
  h1 {
    color: purple;
  }
</style>
```

## Conclusion

Astro is a great choice for building static websites like blogs, documentation sites, landing pages, and portfolios. Its focus on performance while maintaining developer experience makes it stand out from other frameworks.

I hope this introduction helps you get started with Astro! Feel free to check out the [official documentation](https://docs.astro.build) for more information.
